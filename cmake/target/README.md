# Target Configuration

## Overview
This directory contains scripts related to the creation and configuration of targets in the CMake build system. These scripts handle the addition of executables, shared objects, and other target types.

## Files
- `add_all_targets.cmake`: Script for adding multiple targets.
- `add_exe.cmake`: Script for defining executable targets.
- `add_so.cmake`: Script for defining shared object targets.

## Usage
Include these scripts in your main `CMakeLists.txt` or `buildsystem.cmake` to define and configure your build targets.
